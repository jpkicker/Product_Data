UPDATED LABELS
Exclusive carpet labels now have room scenes
Hardwood labels are larger and now feature a swatch image in addition to the room scene

STRATEGIC PLANNING
Targeted Approach: A finite quantity of samples will be available for new intros, ensure placement where they can produce results.
Each Essentials carpet collection is offered in its own sample package to maximize each placement’s success.
Move displays out of under-performing accounts and into key locations

MAINTAIN EXISTING FOOTPRINT FOR THE RIGHT ACCOUNTS
All new card displays are in the two-tier format.
Focus on updating displays to the new schematic replacing dropped products, and new branding with retro kits.

RECOVERY
100% recovery is strongly recommended
Freight is already computed into the cost of the sample & display, so no separate freight line for packages.

SWATCHES
Standard carpet swatch size is 9x9” & 17x13.5” 
Exclusive carpet styles are 27"x17"
Large swatches must be ordered via PVD at full recovery
