The Authentic ConnectorShaw Floors' Consumer Persona
A nurturer at heart, the Authentic Connector, puts family and friends at the center of their world. They desire a home that feels welcoming, warm, and comfortable. 

A lack of confidence in the complexity of home projects leads to aligning with brands and partners they can trust. They typically begin their flooring journey at Home Centers but tend to procrastinate getting started for fear of making a mistake. They rely on recommendations from family and friends as they research home projects.

Compared to other Residential targets they are more likely to have children of all ages living in the home. They also stay in their home longer than any other target.

## Slide 28
PawDefense Technology Demonstrated
PawDefense Technology is a proprietary protective coating that makes Pet Perfect Luxury Vinyl 50% more scratch resistant than traditional luxury vinyl.
The Newton (N) scale in scratch testing refers to the amount of force applied—measured in Newtons—during a scratch resistance test. It quantifies how much pressure a surface can withstand before showing visible deep scratches. This is especially relevant in flooring products where durability against pet claws and daily wear is a key selling point.
Each line represents additional pressure applied during the scratch testing. Traditional LVP shows visible scratching at 6-7 Newtons.  Pet Perfect with Paw Defense doesn't begin to show visible scratch until 12-13 Newtons.

## Slide 34
Shifting to Consumer-Friendly Collection Names
To simplify product branding and make it easier for customers to understand the benefits and features of each flooring type.
Eliminating sub-branding confusion allows Shaw Floors to focus messaging on performance and value, strengthening the connection with consumers.
For 2026, all assets will lead with Luxury Vinyl, while we sunset Floorte Pro and Classic names.
New series names may be introduced in the future, but clarity and consumer benefit are the current priorities.
Floorte Pro & Classic → Shaw Floors Luxury Vinyl | Pro Series (SPC) or Classic Series (WPC)
Shaw Floors is retiring the Floorte Pro and Floorte Classic names to make our product branding more focused on clear consumer benefits. For 2026, all marketing assets will lead with Shaw Floors’ luxury vinyl, with core construction called out on samples and spec sheets. All consumer-facing materials like the website, will lead with Luxury Vinyl and differentiate between WPC and SPC with “Classic Series” for WPC and “Pro Series” for SPC. This shift eliminates sub-branding confusion and puts the emphasis on product performance and value. While new series names may be introduced in the future, our priority now is clarity and connection with our customers by leading with Luxury Vinyl.

Shifting to Consumer-Friendly Collection Names
“The Gallery” was a collection name that didn’t clearly convey product benefits.

All hardwood will now be referred to as Shaw Floors Hardwood.
Products with Repel technology will be called Shaw Floors Hardwood with Repel.
No more sub-branding confusion-just one trusted name.
THE GALLERY → SHAW FLOORS HARDWOOD
The Gallery is a curated collection of hardwoods, designed to evoke artistry and timeless charm. But as we move into 2026, we’re simplifying our hardwood story and messaging. Instead of multiple branded collections, we’re unifying under one name: Shaw Floors Hardwood. This shift makes it easier for our sales teams and consumers alike—no more explaining what “The Gallery” means. Now, it’s clearly about the product that consumers want made by a brand they can trust.
