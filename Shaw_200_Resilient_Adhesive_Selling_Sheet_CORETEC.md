Surfaces to be bonded must be free from moisture, wax, dirt, 
grease, oil, paint, rust or other substances that might interfere 
with a good bond. When installing over light- weight concrete 
ﬁrst apply Shaw 9050 primer. Subﬂoor must be smooth and 
fully adhered. This adhesive is not recommended for use over 
concrete slabs where hydrostatic pressure, excessive mois-
ture or alkali exists. Luxury Vinyl Tile and Plank: Up to 99% 
relative humidity (ASTM F-2170). The pH level of the concrete 
should be a maximum of 12. Both the adhesive and surfaces 
to be bonded must be maintained at a temperature of 65o – 
95o F (18.3o –35.0o C) and between 30% and 60% relative 
humidity for 72 hours before, during and after installation.
Non-Porous Surfaces & Shaw 9050** Primed Surfaces: Tile 
& Plank: Apply Shaw 200 Adhesive with the recommended 
trowel (see trowel chart), allow to dry completely from yellow 
to tan, and lay in the tile or plank according to the ﬂooring 
manufacturer's instructions within 3 hours. The highly 
aggressive pressure sensitive grip prevents slippage and 
minimizes seam gaps. Drying time is 45-90 minutes and will 
vary due to installation site temperature and humidity. 
Installation over areas of incomplete drying can result in job 
failure. After installation is complete, roll and cross roll with a 
100 lb. sectional roller. Use hand roller in areas which cannot 
be reached with larger roller. Check 1 – 2 hours after installing 
ﬂooring material and roll again if necessary.
Note: Coverage is approximate and will vary depending on porosity and roughness of subﬂoor, angle at which the trowel is held, 
temperature of the adhesive and the subﬂoor, and the skill of the installer applying the adhesive. Trowel dimensions are width 
× depth × spacing. Coverage will be improved by priming the subﬂoor to reduce adhesive absorption. Coverage will be signiﬁcantly 
lower over subﬂoors not properly prepared according to established industry guidelines.

Non-Porous Surfaces & Shaw 9050** Primed Surfaces- Sheet 
Goods: Apply Shaw 200 Adhesive with the recommended 
trowel (see trowel chart), back roll the adhesive with a 3/16” 
nap roller immediately after spreading and allow the adhesive 
to set open until dry to touch. (Dry to touch is tacky but no 
transfer to ﬁngers) Time required will vary with ambient 
conditions. After installation is complete, roll and cross roll 
with a 100 lb. sectional roller. Use hand roller in areas which 
cannot be reached with larger roller. Check 1 – 2 hours after 
installing ﬂooring material and roll again if necessary.
Porous Surfaces- Suggest Priming with Shaw 9050: Shaw 200 
Adhesive may be used either wet or as a pressure sensitive 
adhesive over porous surfaces. To use wet, apply adhesive 
with the recommended trowel (see trowel chart) and allow to 
ﬂash oﬀfor 5-10 minutes before installing ﬂooring. 
Lay tile or plank into wet adhesive according to ﬂooring 
manufacturer’s instructions. Adhesive must transfer to ﬂoor 
product to ensure proper bond. To use as a pressure sensitive 
adhesive, allow to dry to a tacky state, then install ﬂooring 
according to ﬂooring manufacturer’s instructions within 3 
hours. If installing sheet goods, back roll wet adhesive with a 
3/16” nap roller immediately after spreading. After installation 
is complete, roll and cross roll with a 100 lb. sectional roller. 
Use hand roller in areas which cannot be reached with larger 
roller. Check 1-2 hours after installing ﬂooring material and 
roll again if necessary.
** Note: Light weight concrete is very porous and will require 
a minimum of two applications of Shaw 9050 to prime 
properly.
Appearance: Smooth, creamy, easy to trowel. Yellow when wet, tan when dry. 
PHYSICAL PROPTERTIES
Base: Amide-Ester-Acrylate Resin Blend
