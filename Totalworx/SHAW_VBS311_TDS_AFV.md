Prepworx VBS311
DESCRIPTION
Prepworx VBS311 is a convenient, one-component, water-based solution designed to block excess moisture in concrete floors. It requires no priming or additional vapor barrier layers and can be easily applied in just two coats. Floor underlayments can be installed in as little as 60 minutes after the second coat, making it ideal for projects that need quick and efficient moisture protection. Suitable for concrete with moisture readings up to 100%, PrepWorx VBS311 streamlines the process, ensuring a reliable foundation for your flooring.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior use
Sound absorbent concrete floor substrates.
SUBSTRATE TESTING
No moisture testing required. Ensure that concrete is dry before application. 
Install when substrate, ambient and material temperatures are a minimum of 50°F (10°C). Concrete surface must be 5°F (and rising) higher than dew point to prevent condensation.
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
The substrate must be structurally sound, clean, dry, and free of contaminants (e.g., dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, etc.) that may affect adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods and d not use acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation.
Concrete must be absorbent. Test for absorbency (ASTM F3191).
Deep vacuum thoroughly after preparation to remove any remaining debris.
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured, dry and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
Ensure all moving joints, including expansion and isolation joints, as well as moving cracks, are properly addressed and accounted for throughout the entire flooring system, including the finish layer. No flooring material should be installed over these areas.
For saw cuts and dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), Prepworx CJR400 must be used to repair.
For concrete surfaces with a profile greater than a maximum CSP 3 contact Shaw Technical Service before continuing with any work
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Mixing
Use a wooden stir stick or a similar tool to hand mix thoroughly, ensuring any settled components are fully re-suspended. Do not use mechanical mixers. 
Do not combine with other additives or water.
Allow for proper ventilation during the drying process.
Application
Do not pour directly onto the substrate or allow pooling; apply the freshly mixed product immediately. Use a 3/8" nap roller and pan to distribute evenly, then back-roll.  
Allow each coat to dry to a tack-free finish (45 minutes for the first coat, 60 minutes for subsequent coats) and wait no longer than 24 hours between coats.  
Apply each coat at a right angle to the previous one, ensuring full coverage.  
Apply at least two coats; additional coats may be needed for very porous or rough surfaces.  
Work the product into the surface to prevent pinholes and use a paintbrush for edges and hard-to-reach areas.  
Fully coat the area before moving on to the next step.
Curing
Drying times vary depending on environmental conditions.
Each coat is dry when it has a tack-free finish (approx. 45 minutes for the first coat, 60 minutes for subsequent coats).
Foot traffic and the installation underlayments or floor coverings using approved adhesives for direct installation on to a moisture control system can begin 60 minutes after the last coat is applied.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverage may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
Coverage is approximately 400 - 500 sq. ft. per gallon (9.8 to 12.2 m² per liter) per coat.
