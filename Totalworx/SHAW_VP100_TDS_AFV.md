PrepWorx VP100 [10lb. + 25lb.]
DESCRIPTION
PrepWorx VP100 is a versatile, Portland Cement-based patch underlayment, perfect for application over concrete substrates prior to installing a wide range of flooring types, including resilient sheet, plank, and tile, ceramic and stone tile, carpet, as well as glue-down and click wood flooring products. Engineered to create smooth, durable surfaces, it provides a solid foundation for all types of floor coverings. Available in 10lb and 25lb bags, PrepWorx VP100 is easy to mix and apply, making it a convenient and efficient solution for a variety of projects.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior use only
Sound concrete slabs on all grade levels.
SUBSTRATE TESTING
Check substrate moisture content per flooring installation requirements.
If RH exceeds acceptable levels, apply a moisture control system such as PrepWorx MCS310 or PrepWorx VBS311.
Install when substrate, product, mix water and ambient temperatures are a minimum of 50°F (10°C).
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods and avoid using acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
Ensure all expansion, isolation joints, and moving cracks are honored through the underlayment and properly treated as per floor covering manufacturer instruction.
For dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), PrepWorx CJR400 may be used to repair. 
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for layout, design and any special instructions for installation.
Mixing
Product strength and performance are dependent on exact mixing ratios:
3 parts powder to 1 part water by volume.
For a 10 lb. bag, mix powder with 1.6 quarts of water.
For a 25 lb. bag, mix powder with 4 quarts of water
Pour water into the container first and then add powder while mixing.
Mix by hand or with a drill to achieve a lump-free consistency.
Mechanical mixing results in a creamier, smoother consistency.
Do not overwater the mixture, as additional water weakens the material.
Application
Use a flat, steel trowel to spread VP 100 to a smooth level surface.
Pot life is approximately 15-20 minutes depending on site ambient conditions.
Product can be remixed without water to maximize pot life.
Product can be installed from a featheredge to 1/2”. 
If a depth greater than 1/2” is needed, material can be installed in multiple lifts up to 1”. Allow each lift to dry completely (typically 1 - 2 hours) before applying additional lifts.
Curing
Drying times vary depending on environmental conditions.
Typically, the product is ready for floor covering in 1-2 hours depending on the thickness of application.
Always refer to floor covering guidelines for installation over cement-based patch products
Ensure proper ventilation to speed up the drying process. Do not apply fans or other forced air to surface.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
Application Depth Approximate Coverage per Bag
10 lb: 	Skimcoat	64 sq ft (5.95 m2)     |	25 lb: Skimcoat 160 sq.ft. (14.8 m2) 
10 lb: 	1/8” (3 mm) 16 sq ft (1.49 m2)	|	25 lb: 1/8” (3 mm) 40 sq ft (3.7 m2)
