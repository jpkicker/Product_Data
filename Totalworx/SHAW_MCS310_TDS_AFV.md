# SHAW MCS310 TDS AFV

Prepworx MCS310
DESCRIPTION
The PrepWorx MCS310 is a 100% solids epoxy that controls moisture vapor emissions through horizontally placed concrete, making it ideal for use before floor coverings or underlayments are installed. It dries quickly in as little as 4 hours, with no sand broadcast required for underlayments up to 1/4” thick. Solvent-free and alkali-resistant, it bonds strongly to concrete and is perfect for commercial and residential projects. It can be installed at temperatures as low as 50°F (10°C) and meets ASTM E96 (0.06 perms) and exceeds ASTM F3010-18 standards.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior use
Sound concrete surfaces
Absorbent terrazzo laid on concrete - Must be sound, solid and well-bonded to underlying, structurally sound substrates. Metallic terrazzo strips must be mechanically removed. Contact Shaw Technical Service before continuing with any work.
SUBSTRATE TESTING
No moisture testing is required. Ensure that concrete is dry before application. 
Install when substrate, ambient and material temperatures are a minimum of 50°F (10°C). Concrete surface must be 5°F (and rising) higher than dew point to prevent condensation.
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Concrete and terrazzo substrates need to be a minimum CSP 3 (maximum CSP 5).
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles, alkali, and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean and profile surfaces using mechanical methods, such as shot blasting, and do not use acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
Ensure all moving joints, including expansion and isolation joints, as well as moving cracks, are properly addressed and accounted for throughout the entire flooring system, including the finish layer. No flooring material should be installed over these areas.
For saw cuts and dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), Prepworx CJR400 must be used to repair.
(If/as needed): For concrete surfaces with a profile too rough to apply a consistent film thickness (above CSP #5), contact Shaw Technical Service before continuing with any work.
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Mixing
Thoroughly mix resin (Part A) before adding hardener (Part B).
Add all contents of hardener (Part B) into resin (Part A) and mix for at least 3 minutes using a low-speed drill and epoxy mixing paddle.
Pour some of the mixture back into the hardener (Part B) container, mix for 30 seconds, then return it to the resin (Part A) container.
Mix for an additional 30 seconds to ensure full reaction of hardener.
Immediately pour the mixture onto the prepared concrete surface to avoid heat buildup. If heat buildup occurs in the container, do not touch it. Loosely close the lid and move the container to a cooler area until it sets and cools.
Allow for proper ventilation during the installation process.
Application Option #1
10 mils / 250 microns with primer:
Immediately pour the mixed product onto the prepared surface (avoid placing container upside down).
Apply the epoxy at least 10 mil (250 microns) thick, using a mil gauge to verify the required thickness.
Use a short-nap roller or notched squeegee for smooth surfaces, or longer-nap roller for uneven substrates.
Work product into the surface to avoid pinholes; use a paintbrush for edges and hard to reach areas.
Coat the entire area before proceeding.
After 4+ hours of drying, apply Prepworx QBC300 primer.
Allow Prepworx QBC300 primer to dry to a thin, opaque white film (minimum 30 minutes).
Apply self-leveling underlayment at a maximum thickness of 1/2” (12 mm).
       Application Option #2
14 mils / 350 microns with sand.
Immediately pour the mixed product onto the prepared surface (avoid placing container upside down).
Apply the epoxy at least 14 mil (350 microns) thick, using a mil gauge to verify the required thickness.
Use a short-nap roller or notched squeegee for smoother surfaces, or longer-nap roller for uneven substrates.
Work product into the surface to avoid pinholes; use a paintbrush for edges and hard-to-reach areas.
Coat the entire area before proceeding.
While wet (up to 20 minutes), broadcast clean, dry, fine sand (1/40” - 1/50” grain size or sieve #30/#35) while wearing a NIOSH-approved dust mask.
Use ~1 lb. of sand per sq. ft.
Avoid walking on freshly applied epoxy when broadcasting sand.
After sand is applied, walking is allowed but avoid disturbing the epoxy.
Avoid traffic on the surface until the epoxy is set. Allow 4 hours to set.
Once set, remove excess sand using a rubber squeegee to pile it, then shovel into designated barrels.  
Filter collected sand to remove debris for future use.
Vacuum remaining sand with a heavy-duty vacuum (Shop-Vac-style) and HEPA dust extraction system.  
The clean sanded surface acts as the primer for the underlayment or topping—no additional priming is needed.  
The sanded surface can remain open indefinitely, as long as it’s not contaminated.  
If installation is delayed, protect the surface from construction traffic, dirt, and debris.
Refer to the technical data sheet for the selected underlayment for maximum allowable thickness that can be applied.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
Application Depth Approximate Coverage per unit of Prepworx MCS310
10 mils (250 microns):
Approx. 250 – 270 sq. ft. (23 – 25 sq. m) per mixed unit of Prepworx MCS310
Approx. 150 – 165 sq. ft. per gallon (3.8 – 4 sq. m per liter)
14 mils (350 microns):
Approx. 170 – 190 sq. ft. (16 – 18 sq. m) per mixed unit of Prepworx MCS310
Approx. 100 – 115 sq. ft. per gallon (2.5 – 2.8 sq. m per liter)
