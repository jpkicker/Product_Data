PrepWorx CJR400
DESCRIPTION
CJR400 is a fast-setting, two-part polyurethane repair solution designed for cracks, control joints, spalls, and pop-outs on both interior and exterior concrete surfaces. It begins to set in as little as 2 minutes and is ready for service in 10 to 15 minutes. The repair can be trafficked within 45 minutes, making it perfect for filling cracks and saw-cuts before applying moisture control systems, underlayments, or toppings.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior and exterior concrete use.
SUBSTRATE TESTING
Ensure that concrete is dry before application. 
Install when substrate, ambient and material temperatures are a minimum of 0°F (-18°C) and a maximum of 85°F (32°C).
Do not use on chemically abated concrete.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
The substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and dry.
Cracks should be free from dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles, and any other substances that could interfere with adhesion.
Avoid using sweeping compounds, solvents, acid etching, or sanding for cleaning; instead, use mechanical methods for proper bonding preparation.
Concrete substrates must be fully cured and free from hydrostatic pressure and moisture.
Prepare cracks with a dry diamond blade to ensure a clean surface for optimal bonding.
A wire brush or twisted wire wheel can help remove loose concrete or dirt.
New concrete should be fully cured, stable, and free of movement.
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for layout, design and any special instructions for installation.
Setup
Keep the cartridge and nozzle pointed into a containment vessel during purging, initial nozzle blending, and the initial dispensing of material.
After initial dispensing, always point the cartridge downward when not dispensing to prevent material from flowing back into the cartridge.
Dispense a small amount of material onto a disposable surface until both components flow evenly before attaching the mixing nozzle.
Application
Attach the nozzle to the cartridge and tighten in a clockwise direction.
PrepWorx CJR400 has a short pot life (2 minutes) – apply continuously to avoid clogging.
Place the nozzle directly over the crack or repair area and dispense with smooth, full trigger pulls.
For moisture control systems or underlayments, immediately broadcast clean #30 or #35 sand into the fresh material.
For standalone repairs, overfill the area slightly higher than the slab surface.
For spalls & pop-outs: Mix PrepWorx CJR400 1:1 with dry sand to form a paste, then fill and smooth using a trowel or putty knife.
Mix PrepWorx CJR400 1:1 with dry sand to form a paste, then fill and smooth using a trowel or putty knife.
Ensure the sand is completely dry to prevent paste from swelling.
Curing
Repairs are ready for use in 10-15 minutes (at 75°F) and can be ground smooth in about 45 minutes.
For clean-up, use Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) or similar solvent while material is still fresh, following all safety instructions.
Once cured, PrepWorx CJR400 can only be removed by grinding or similar methods. 
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates depend on the depth of the fill area.
