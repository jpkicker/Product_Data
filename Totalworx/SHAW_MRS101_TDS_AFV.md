PrepWorx MRS101
DESCRIPTION
PrepWorx MRS101 is designed to create smooth, even surfaces on a variety of substrates and is perfect for environments with high moisture, up to 100% RH. Suitable for both interior and exterior applications, it can be installed in temperatures as low as 40°F (5°C). Easy to mix with water, it applies smoothly to a true feathered edge, and floor coverings can be installed as soon as 30 minutes after application.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior and exterior use
Sound concrete surfaces
Absorbent terrazzo laid on concrete
Untreated plywood subfloors (indoor use only)
Solid hardwood (must be properly bonded and free of any secondary finishes such as colorant and sealers
Gypsum (not suitable for strengthening weak gypsum surfaces) (Must prime with PrepWorx QBC300)
PrepWorx MCS310 moisture control systems on concrete
Non-porous surfaces:
Cement-based terrazzo
Ceramic, porcelain, or quarry tiles
Epoxy or epoxy terrazzo coatings
Non-water-soluble adhesive residue on concrete
Can be used for minor substrate preparation under moisture mitigation products in isolated areas, but not as a substitute for mechanical preparation.
SUBSTRATE TESTING
No moisture testing required. Ensure that concrete surface is dry before application. 
Although product is not affected by moisture, it is not a moisture vapor barrier. Check substrate moisture content per flooring installation requirements.
If RH exceeds acceptable levels, apply a moisture control system such as PrepWorx MCS310 or PrepWorx VBS311.
Install when product, mix water, substrate and ambient temperatures are a minimum of 40°F (5°C) 
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and surface dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods, and avoid using acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation.
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
For non-structural cracks and saw cuts deeper that 1”, PrepWorx MRS101 or QVR110 is recommended.
Ensure all expansion, isolation joints, and moving cracks are properly treated.
For dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), PrepWorx CJR400 may be used to repair.
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for layout, design and any special instructions for installation.
Mixing
Product strength and performance are dependent on exact mixing ratios:
3.25 parts powder to 1 part water by volume.
For a 10 lb. bag, mix with 1 3/4 quarts (1.65 L) of clean water.
Mix as much as can be installed in a 15-20 minute time period.
Pour water into the container first, and then add powder while mixing.
Mix with a heavy-duty drill (min. 650 rpm) for 2-3 minutes to achieve a smooth, lump-free consistency. 
Do not overwater the mixture, as additional water weakens the material.
For small batches, mix by hand with a margin trowel and stir again before application. 
Application
Use a flat, steel trowel to spread MRS101 to a smooth level surface.
Pot life is approximately 15-20 minutes depending on site ambient conditions.
For exterior applications, use a maximum thickness of 1/4”; for interiors, up to 1/2”.
Product can be remixed without water to maximize pot life.
Curing
Drying times vary depending on environmental conditions.
Typically, the product is ready for floor covering in 30 minutes, but for wood floors or high-performance adhesives, allow up to 16 hours.
Foot traffic and installation of most floor coverings can begin in 30-60 minutes depending on the thickness and substrate.
Always refer to floor covering guidelines for installation over cement-based patch products.
Ensure proper ventilation to speed up the drying process. Do not apply fans or other forced air to surface.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
Application Depth Approximate Coverage per 10 lb bag
Skim Coat 200 - 250 sq ft (18.6 -23.2 m2)
1/8” (3 mm) 28 sq ft (2.6 m2)
1/4" (6 mm) 14 sq ft (1.3 m2)
1/2" (12 mm) 7 sq ft (0.65 m2)
PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for installation.
