PrepWorx VL201
DESCRIPTION
PrepWorx VL201 is a high-flow, self-leveling underlayment that can be reworked and refreshed for extended work time, offering flexibility for flooring projects. It smoothly levels a variety of interior substrates, even with up to 99% RH. Self-leveling up to 1 inch, it can be easily applied by pouring or pumping. With a healing time of up to 25 minutes when applied with a spiked roller, it creates a durable, flat surface, providing an ideal base for finished flooring at any grade level.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior use
Sound concrete surfaces
Absorbent terrazzo laid on concrete
PrepWorx moisture control systems on concrete
Non-porous surfaces such as:
Cement-based terrazzo
Ceramic, porcelain, or quarry tiles
Epoxy or epoxy terrazzo coatings
Non-water-soluble adhesive residue on concrete
SUBSTRATE TESTING
Test concrete according to ASTM F2170. This product can be installed over concrete with RH levels up to 99% for high-moisture floor coverings and adhesives, as long as a vapor retarder  meeting ASTM E1745 standards is in place.
If RH exceeds acceptable levels, apply a moisture control system like PrepWorx MCS310 or PrepWorx VBS311.
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and surface dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods and avoid using acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation.
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
It is recommended to fill dormant cracks and saw cuts deeper that 1”, using PrepWorx MRP10 or QVR110.
Ensure all expansion, isolation joints, and moving cracks are properly treated
For dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), PrepWorx CJR400 may be used to repair.
Ensure all moving joints, including expansion and isolation joints, as well as moving cracks, are properly addressed and accounted for throughout the entire flooring system, including the finish layer. No flooring material should be installed over these areas.
If no moisture control system is needed, prime the clean surface with PrepWorx QBC300. 
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for layout, design and any special instructions for installation.
Mixing
Product strength and performance are dependent on exact mixing ratios. Mix each 50 lb. bag with 5 – 5 ¼ quarts (4.73 – 4.97 L) of clean water.
Mix two bags at a time by adding the water first, then gradually incorporating the powder while mixing.
Mix with a heavy-duty drill (min. 650 rpm) for 2-3 minutes to achieve a smooth, lump-free consistency. 
Do not overwater the mixture, as additional water weakens the material. 
Application
Pour the mix onto the floor and spread with a spreader. Immediately smooth the material with a smoother or use a spiked roller.
Work continuously during the entire installation. Wear plastic-cleated shoes to avoid leaving marks.
Apply at a minimum thickness of 1/16'' (1.5 mm) over the highest point, with an average thickness of 1/8'' (3 mm) over the entire floor. For thin applications, taper the product to match existing elevations.
Thickness of application:
When installed over PrepWorx VBS311 Moisture Control: ¼” (6mm)
When installed over substrates primed with PrepWorx QBC300: ½” (12mm) 
When installed over PrepWorx MCS310 with Sand Broadcast: 1” (24mm)
For installations over ½”, product must be mixed at low-end water ratio.
Product can be pumped for higher productivity using automatic mixing pumps.
Curing
Drying times may vary based on environmental conditions and the thickness of the application.
Foot traffic can begin 2-3 hours after installation.
For ceramic, porcelain, or quarry tiles, allow up to 6 hours for curing.
Most floor coverings can be installed after 24 hours, depending on thickness and substrate. For applications greater than 3/8” (9 mm), conduct a mat test (ASTM D4263) before installing floor coverings.
Always refer to floor covering guidelines for installation over cement-based patch products.
Ensure proper ventilation for sufficient curing. Do not apply fans or other forced air to surface.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
Application Depth Approximate Coverage per 50 lb bag
1/8” (3 mm) 50 sq ft (4.65 m2)
1/4" (6 mm) 25 sq ft (2.32 m2)
PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for installation.
