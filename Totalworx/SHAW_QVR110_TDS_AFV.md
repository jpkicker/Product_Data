PrepWorx QVR110
DESCRIPTION
PrepWorx QVR110 is a quick-drying, versatile repair product, ideal for ramping and patching large areas. It provides a fast-setting, self-drying solution for smoothing and repairing various substrates, including concrete, wood, gypsum, and non-porous surfaces, prior to new floor installations. It can be applied up to 1” thick without aggregate or extended to 3” with aggregate for deeper applications.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior use
Sound concrete surfaces
Absorbent terrazzo laid on concrete
Untreated plywood subfloors*
Solid hardwood, free of all coatings and stains (must be properly bonded)*
Gypsum (not suitable for strengthening weak gypsum surfaces)*
PrepWorx MCS310 moisture control systems on concrete
Non-porous surfaces:
Cement-based terrazzo
Ceramic, porcelain, or quarry tiles
Epoxy or epoxy terrazzo coatings
Non-water-soluble adhesive residue on concrete
*Approved wood and gypsum-based substrates must be primed prior to installation of PrepWorx QVR110. 
SUBSTRATE TESTING
Check substrate moisture content per flooring installation requirements. If RH exceeds acceptable levels, apply a moisture control system such as PrepWorx MCS310 or VBS311. See product technical specifications for complete application instructions.
This product can be installed over concrete with RH levels up to 99% for high-moisture floor coverings and adhesives, as long as a vapor retarder meeting ASTM E1745 standards is used.
Install when product, mix water, substrate and ambient temperatures are a minimum of 50°F (10°C).
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and surface dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods, and avoid using acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation.
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
Ensure all moving joints, including expansion and isolation joints, as well as moving cracks, are properly addressed and accounted for throughout the entire flooring system, including the finish layer. No flooring material should be installed over these areas.
For dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), PrepWorx CJR400 may be used to repair. 
Non-structural voids such as saw cuts and dormant cracks can be filled with PrepWorx MRP101, prior to installation of PrepWorx QVR110.
Wood and gypsum-based substrates must be primed with PrepWorx QBC300 prior to installation of PrepWorx QVR110.See primer technical data sheet for application instructions.
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for layout, design and any special instructions for installation. 
Mixing
Product strength and performance are dependent on exact mixing ratios: 
4 parts powder to 1 part water by volume.
For a 40 lb. bag, mix with 3 3/4 quarts (3.5 L) of clean water.
Mix as much as can be installed in a 40-minute time period.
Pour water into the container first and then add powder while mixing. 
Mix with a heavy-duty drill (min. 650 rpm) for 2-3 minutes to achieve a smooth, lump-free consistency. 
Do not overwater the mixture, as additional water weakens the material.
For small batches, mix by hand with a margin trowel or mixing paddle and stir again before application. 
Aggregate Extension
Use washed, well-graded pea gravel, no larger than 1/3 the pour depth and no smaller than 1/8”. Do not use sand.
Mix with water first, then add 1 part gravel by volume, mixing until fully coated.
Adding aggregate may reduce workability, possibly requiring a neat coat installation.
Application
Pot life is approximately 40 minutes depending on site ambient conditions.
For neat applications, maximum thickness is 1” (25.4 mm); for aggregate applications, up to 3” (7.6 cm).
Product can be remixed without water to maximize pot life.
Use a flat, wood or magnesium trowel to spread QVR110 to a smooth level surface and key the material into the substrate to achieve a good mechanical bond. Once placed and has taken an initial set, finishing with a steel trowel can begin.
Use a screed to place material to a desired, variable thickness, and allow product to dry. 
Curing
Drying times vary depending on environmental conditions.
Typically, the product is ready for floor covering in 90 minutes, but for wood floors or high-performance adhesives, allow 16 hours.
Always refer to floor covering guidelines for installation over cement-based patch products.
Ensure proper ventilation to speed up the drying process. Do not apply fans or other forced air to surface.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
Application Depth Approximate Coverage per 40 lb bag
1/8” (3 mm) 50 sq ft (4.6 m2)
1/4" (6 mm) 25 sq ft (2.3 m2)
PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for installation.
WARRANTY
Standard product warranty is 1 year.  When used with certain PrepWorx moisture management and flooring adhesive products, the term of warranty is a max of 20-years. See PrepWorx System Warranty for complete details. 
PRECAUTIONS
