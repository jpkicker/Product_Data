PrepWorx QBC300
DESCRIPTION
PrepWorx QBC300 is a ready-to-apply, quick-drying primer suitable for both interior and exterior surfaces. Its specialized formula helps reduce drips and splashes, making it easy to work with. Use it as a bonding layer before the installation of tile setting materials or self-leveling products. This primer creates a textured finish on smooth surfaces and is ideal for moisture-prone areas like kitchens, bathrooms, and patios.
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior and exterior use
Concrete (both absorbent and non-absorbent, steel-troweled)
Cement-based and epoxy terrazzo
Gypsum surfaces (Follow absorbent substrate guidelines listed below)
Cementitious patching and leveling compounds
Sand/cement screeds
Porcelain, ceramic, glass, quarry tiles, and most natural stone
Cement-based agglomerate tiles
Glazed cement masonry units
PrepWorx MCS310
Exterior rated plywood subfloors – interior only.
Radiant-heated subfloors (up to 85°F/29°C)
Properly prepared, non-soluble adhesive residues on concrete  
Well-prepared epoxy terrazzo surfaces
Agglomerate marble and poured epoxy flooring  
SUBSTRATE TESTING
If RH exceeds acceptable levels associated with the floor covering and/or adhesive, apply a moisture control system like PrepWorx MCS310 or PrepWorx VBS311. Ensure that concrete surface is dry and alkali free before application. 
Install when substrate, ambient, material and water temperatures are a minimum of 50°F (10°C) (Maximum 85°F / 29°C).
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and surface dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods and avoid using acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation.
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture.
For cracks and saw cuts deeper that 1”, PrepWorx MRP101 or QVR110 is recommended.
For dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), PrepWorx CJR400 may be used to repair.
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Read and follow the product specific installation guidelines for layout, design and any special instructions for installation.
Mixing
Stir thoroughly with a wooden paint stirrer or similar tool to fully re-suspend any settled components.  
Do not use mechanical mixing or additives.
Required for highly absorbent substrates to reduce air bubbles, dilute PrepWorx QBC300 with water as follows, stirring well before applying.
Add up to 3 quarts (2.8 L) per 4-gallon (15.14 L) unit.
Application
Spread a thin, even layer of freshly mixed product onto the prepared concrete.
Load a 3/8" nap roller with the product, apply evenly in one direction, and then back roll.
Curing
Drying times vary depending on environmental conditions
Allow the primer to dry to a thin, opaque white layer (at least 30 minutes).
Once dry, there is no required waiting period before applying underlayments or tile mortar, but it’s best to proceed promptly to avoid contamination or damage.
Ensure proper ventilation to speed up the drying process
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application.
