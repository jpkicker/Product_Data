PrepWorx QL202
DESCRIPTION
PrepWorx QL202 is a quick drying, high flow self leveling underlayment designed to level and smooth concrete, terrazzo, ceramic and quarry tile, epoxy coatings, and non-water-soluble adhesive residue. Intended for interior use, it can be applied in temperatures as low as 50°F (10°C). 
Once applied, most floor coverings can be installed in as little as 2 hours*. 
The product can be applied up to 1” thick. Substrates primed with PrepWorx QBC300, the maximum thickness is 1/2” (12 mm).
APPROVED SUBSTRATES
For interior use
Sound concrete surfaces
Absorbent terrazzo laid on concrete
PrepWorx MCS310 moisture control system on concrete
Non-porous surfaces such as:
Cement-based terrazzo
Ceramic, porcelain, or quarry tiles
Epoxy or epoxy terrazzo coatings
Non-water-soluble adhesive residue on concrete
SUBSTRATE TESTING
Test concrete according to ASTM F2170. This product can be installed over concrete with RH levels up to 99% for high-moisture floor coverings and adhesives, as long as a vapor retarder meeting ASTM E1745 standards is present.
If concrete RH exceeds acceptable levels per flooring selection, apply a moisture control system like PrepWorx MCS310 or PrepWorx VBS311.
Install when substrate, ambient, material and water temperatures are a minimum of 50°F (10°C).
Do not use over chemically abated substrates.
SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
Substrate must be structurally sound, clean, and dry.
Substrate must be free of dust, dirt, oil, grease, paint, curing agents, concrete sealers, adhesives, loosely bonded toppings, loose particles and any other substance or condition that may prevent or reduce adhesion.
Clean surfaces using mechanical methods and do not use acid etching or sanding, which will not provide adequate bonding preparation.
Concrete and cementitious substrates must be fully cured and free of hydrostatic pressure and topical moisture or water.
For cracks and saw cuts deeper than 1”, PrepWorx MRS101 or QVR110 is recommended.
For dormant cracks larger than 1/32” (0.8 mm), PrepWorx CJR400 may be used to repair.
Ensure all moving joints, including expansion and isolation joints, as well as moving cracks, are properly addressed and accounted for throughout the entire flooring system, including the finish layer. No flooring material should be installed over these areas.
If using PrepWorx MCS310, the concrete must be prepared to a minimum CSP 3 and a maximum CSP 5.
If no moisture control system is needed, prime the clean surface with PrepWorx QBC300. The maximum thickness of application over QBC300 is 1/2” (12 mm).
APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COVERAGE RATES
Mixing
Mix two bags at a time by adding the water first, then gradually incorporating the powder while mixing.
For each 50 lb. bag, mix with 6 - 6 ½ quarts (5.68 – 6.15 L) of clean water.
Mix with a heavy-duty drill (min. 650 rpm) for 2 - 3 minutes to achieve a smooth, lump-free consistency.
Do not overwater the mixture, as additional water weakens the material.
Application
Pour the mixture onto the floor and spread with a spreader. Immediately smooth the material with a smoother or use a spiked roller.
Work continuously during the entire installation. Wear cleated athletic shoes with non-metallic spikes to avoid leaving marks.
Apply at a minimum thickness of 1/16'' (1.5 mm) over the highest point, with an average thickness of 1/8'' (3 mm) over the entire floor. For thin applications, taper the product to match existing elevations. For the use of wet set adhesives over properly prepared and primed non-porous substrates, an 1/8” minimum of application is required.
Product can be pumped for higher productivity using automatic mixing pumps.
Curing
Drying times vary depending on environmental conditions
Thickness of ½” (12 mm) or less:
Wood or high-performance adhesive flooring (epoxies, urethanes): 12 hours.
Moisture-insensitive tile (ceramic, quarry, porcelain): 2 hours.
All other floor coverings: 2 hours.
Thickness of greater than ½” (12 mm):
Wood or high-performance adhesive flooring (epoxies, urethanes): 12 hours.
Moisture-insensitive tile (ceramic, quarry, porcelain): 2 hours.
All other floor coverings: 4 hours.
Ensure proper ventilation to speed up the drying process.
Coverage Rates
Coverage rates are approximate values. Actual coverages may vary according to substrate conditions and thickness of the application. Application Depth Approximate Coverage per 50 lb bag.
1/8” (3 mm) 56 sq ft (5.2 m2)
1/4“ (6 mm) 28 sq ft (2.6 m2)
