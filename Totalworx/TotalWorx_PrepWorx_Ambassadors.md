Performance Begins Below the Surface.

Every successful flooring installation starts with the right foundation.
Subfloor prep plays a critical role in protecting your investment —reducing the risk of failure, improving long-term performance, and ensuring a smoother, more efficient installation process.

PrepWorx is a system-based approach to floor prep. Designed to meet a range of project conditions — from moisture concerns to surface repairs — each system provides a clear path from subfloor to finished flooring.

Designed by Shaw's technical experts, our curated systems address the most common jobsite conditions with speed, simplicity, and confidence. For added flexibility, you can also build your own prep solution by selecting from our organized Series of individual products —tailored to handle everything from moisture mitigation to leveling and repair.
