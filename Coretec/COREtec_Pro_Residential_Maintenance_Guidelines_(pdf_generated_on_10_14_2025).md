Maintenance Guidelines
RESIDENTIAL RESILIENT MAINTENANCE
 Proper care will help protect and maintain the appearance and performance of your resilient floor.
 
A Care Program Consists of Key Areas:
1. Post-Construction Maintenance
2. Preventative Maintenance
3. Routine Maintenance
4. Spot and Spill Removal.
  
For New Construction or Renovation: Construction dust and joint compound can be deposited on the flooring. If it is not completely
removed and then wet mopped, it will create a haze on the surface of the flooring.
 
POST-CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE
 
Dry mop floor using a microfiber mop pad or appropriate floor vacuum to remove dust particulate from the floor.
Spray neutral pH cleaner, such as Encore, COREtec Cleaner or equivalent neutral pH floor cleaner, onto the floor in
manageable areas (spray mist will dry quickly). Use a microfiber wet mop pad to mop the floor with cleaner. If pad becomes
dirty, be sure to replace the pad with a new microfiber wet mop pad. Mop floor in sections.
Always rinse the floor with water only by mopping with water to remove any remaining residue from the floor.
 
In the event where dry wall dust/construction dust is mopped with water only, a residue film will appear on the floor after drying. Use
the process below to remove the film from the floor. 
 
PROCESS TO REMOVE CONSTRUCTION RESIDUE OR CLOUDY FILM FROM RESILIENT FLOORING
1. Dry mop floor to remove any construction dust or exterior soil tracked onto the flooring. Use microfiber dry mop pad. If
microfiber dry mop pad gets dirty, replace pad with a clean pad.
 
2. Spray neutral pH cleaner, such as Encore, COREtec Floor Cleaner or equivalent neutral pH floor cleaner onto the floor in
manageable areas (spray mist will dry quickly). Clean floor in sections. For smooth surface, use a low rpm (175 rpm) buffer with
a 3M red pad on flooring with neutral pH cleaner applied to the floor to remove the residue film. (Never Dry Buff). For embossed
or textured flooring, use a cylindrical brush scrubber, such as the Clark MA10 12E Scrubber and a neutral pH floor cleaner
applied to the floor to remove the residue film.
 
3. Using a wet microfiber mop pad, rinse with water only to remove any remaining residue from the flooring. When wet mop pad
becomes dirty, be sure to replace the pad with a new microfiber wet mop pad.
4. Repeat steps #2 and #3, if necessary.
 
 
When the resilient flooring is cleaned properly, the floor will have the same visual as right out of the box!

Maintenance Guidelines
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE
 
Always protect floors when moving heavy objects to prevent permanent scratches and tears.
Adhering tape to the surface of your resilient flooring could damage the surface. 
Do not use tape to secure floor protection directly to the floor during construction or renovation. Instead, adhere tape to the
material used to protect the floor and secure it to the base molding along the wall.  A material such as ram board can also be
used to protect your flooring.
Use appropriate wide floor protectors under tables, chairs, and any other heavy home furnishing to avoid permanent damage.
Walk-off mats should be used at all entrances to absorb soil and moisture. If mats are placed directly on top of the resilient
floors, use mats without latex or rubber backings to avoid possible discoloration.
Use appropriate window coverings to avoid direct sunlight as this can fade the color of the flooring.
​Avoid using mop and shine products on your resilient flooring.
Some disinfectants contain chemicals that can stain, discolor and cause general harm to your flooring product.  Quaternary
Ammonium Salts are among those that have been found to be harmful to your flooring when used over time.  Take care to
choose pH neutral products only.  
 
ROUTINE MAINTENANCE
Daily removal of dirt and dust is important to prevent particles from abrading the surface of resilient floors. Sweeping, dust
mopping, and vacuuming are recommendations to remove soil particles that can result in scratches and worn appearances. Do
not use vacuums with rotating beater bars on hard surfaces.
Periodic wet cleaning will be necessary to help maintain the floor’s appearance. Always pre- vacuum or dust mop before any
type of wet cleaning. Appropriate vinyl floor cleaning equipment and cleaning agents (neutral pH floor cleaners) are
recommended. Do not use abrasive cleaners or cleaning agents that leave dull residues on the surface of the floors. Follow the
cleaning manufacturer’s instructions for damp mopping and application. If rinsing is necessary, use clean water and expedite
drying with air movers or fans.
Encore, COREtec neutral pH floor cleaner or equivalent floor cleaner are recommended for general spotting and cleaning.
​Avoid using mop and shine products on your resilient flooring.
​Products containing bleach and steam mops are not recommended.
 
SPOT & SPILL REMOVAL
 Our flooring products are engineered to resist and minimize common staining. 
Absorb wet spills as quickly as possible by blotting with paper or cloth towels. Rinse with water if necessary and blot dry.
Dried spots should be removed by gentle agitation and rinsed with water. Blot dry.
Use Encore, COREtec cleaning products or products formulated for vinyl floor cleaning. Do not use detergents or abrasive
cleaners since these products can leave a dull residue.
Use rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) with a clean white cloth for spots requiring a solvent type cleaner that water and cleaning
agents cannot remove.
Please note that some stain conditions may become permanent.
Safety Caution: The surfaces of resilient floors change during wet cleaning and finish applications. Use appropriate safety measures.
